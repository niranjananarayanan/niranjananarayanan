The major goal of the Seminar Hall Booking System is to keep track of all seminar hall booking dates, slot, and availability for all departments. 
The project is completely restricted at the administrative level, and department members can only access only specific functions. 
The goal of the project is to create a web app that will reduce manual labor in managing seminar room bookings. 
Report on the booking, status and history of booking is generated automatically.
